# üß© Maze Solver

## üìù Project Overview
The **Maze Solver** is an interactive web application that allows users to create and solve mazes using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The app is built with React and features a dynamic interface where users can set the size of the maze, define start and end points, and visualize the algorithm's pathfinding process in real-time. This project is an excellent demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving and interactive web design, making it a valuable addition to any developer's portfolio.

## üí° Features
- **Dynamic Maze Generation:**  
  Users can generate mazes of varying sizes by specifying the dimensions. The maze grid is dynamically created, allowing for a customizable experience.

- **Interactive Tile Selection:**  
  Click or drag across the grid to create walls or clear paths. Users can also set start and end points, making the maze-solving process more engaging.

- **BFS Algorithm Visualization:**  
  The app visualizes the BFS algorithm in action, showing the exploration of nodes and the eventual shortest path from the start to the end point.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices, whether on desktop or mobile.

- **Real-Time Feedback:**  
  Immediate visual feedback as users interact with the maze, with smooth transitions and animations.
